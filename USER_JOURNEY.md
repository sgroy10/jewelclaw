## Step 8: AI Conversation (Natural Language)

Users can ask anything in natural language (English, Hindi, or Hinglish). The AI agent understands context and uses tools.

**User sends:** `Bhai aaj gold khareedna chahiye ya nahi?`

**JewelClaw responds:**
```
Rahul bhai, aaj ka scene:

Gold 24K ₹15,804 pe hai, pichle hafte se ₹180 upar gaya.
Lekin your buy target ₹15,500 hai - abhi ₹304 upar hai.

Meri advice: 2-3 din wait karo. US jobs data Friday ko
aayega, agar weak aaya toh gold neeche aa sakta hai.

Agar urgent khareedna hai toh aaj 22K pe ₹14,491 mil raha hai
which is decent for daily stock.
```

**User sends:** `I charge 18% making on heavy bridal sets`

**JewelClaw responds:**
```
Got it! Saved to your profile:

Bridal sets: 18% making charge

I'll use this for future quotes. Try:
quote 50g 22k bridal necklace
```

**User sends:** `My wife Priya's birthday is November 1st`

**JewelClaw responds:**
```
Saved! I'll remind you before Priya's birthday on November 1st.

You'll get a reminder at midnight + 8 AM with a personalized
greeting you can forward.
